Ez Crypto Tips is a non-custodial, multi-chain tipping platform built on Hedera Hashgraph. It bridges the gap between Web3 and the real-world service industry by allowing guests to tip waiters instantly via QR code using HBAR, USDC, or USDT (supporting Hedera, Tron, and Base networks). Beyond payments, the platform utilizes the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to record customer reviews on-chain, creating an immutable "Proof-of-Service" reputation system for hospitality workers
